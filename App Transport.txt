App Transport Security
- a new level of security b/w your app and web services
- needed if your app creates a connection using URLConnection or URLSession
- Rejects any insecure connection

- change the info.plist file, created every time you create a project
- can be dictionary
- can allow any/all http (Insecure) connections, never want to produce an app like that

- Firebase takes care of some stuff, they assume that your data isn't sensitive
